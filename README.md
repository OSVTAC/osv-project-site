# Open Source Voting System Project

This page serves as an informational “portal” or clearinghouse for San
Francisco's Open Source Voting System Project.

Below is a listing of written reports and other official documents related to
the project, in reverse chronological order. For additional background, some
documents related to San Francisco's use of _non_-open source voting systems
are also included.


## Ongoing

* **["Open Source Voting System Project
  Recommendations"](https://osvtac.github.io/recommendations/)** (HTML),
  San Francisco Open Source Voting System Technical Advisory Committee
  (OSVTAC).

  This web page contains OSVTAC's latest recommendations for the City and
  County of San Francisco’s open source voting system project. The
  recommendations are a work in progress and updated periodically. The
  recommendations are hosted on GitHub. OSVTAC discusses and votes on changes
  to this document at its monthly meetings, using an iterative process in
  public view -- similar to how open source projects are developed.

  Commission"](https://osvtac.github.io/communications#reports-to-the-commission)**

  Committee (OSVTAC).
