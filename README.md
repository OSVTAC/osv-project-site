# Open Source Voting System Project

This page serves as an informational “portal” or clearinghouse for San
Francisco's Open Source Voting System Project.

It contains a list of written reports and other official documents related to
the open source voting system project. Each item listed also includes a short
summary. For additional background, the list also includes documents related
to San Francisco's use of _non_-open source voting systems.

OSVTAC voted to create this page at its meeting on July 10, 2018, in response
to a recommendation of the 2017-18 San Francisco Civil Grand Jury (CGJ)
Report. The CGJ recommendation (Recommendation #3, or R3) is on page 22 of
their report, which appears below under June 29, 2018.
